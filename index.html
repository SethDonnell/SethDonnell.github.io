                                    <p class="text-muted">I have enjoyed aviation since I was a young boy, especially commercial aviation. I love seeing big jet airplanes flying over me. I especially tend to enjoy bigger and older types of airplanes, such as the Boeing 747
                                        or my all-time favorite, the McDonnell Douglas DC-10. My favorite airline in terms of looks is United Airlines, while Southwest Airlines is my favorite to fly with.</p>

                                    <p class="text-muted">I have been fascinated with trains since I was a toddler. I love watching these awesome machines hauling passengers and freight across the world. My all-time favorite trains are, of course, North American ones. I enjoy
                                        all types of trains, but I especially enjoy freight trains. My all-time favorite locomotive model is the EMD SD40-2 diesel locomotive.My top three favorite railroad companies (in no particular order) are Amtrak,
                                        Norfolk Southern Railway, and Canadian National Railway. I enjoy watching trains (railfanning) in-person as much as I can. I have railfanned at Spartanburg, SC while at BJU.</p>

                                    <h3>Family</h3>
                                    <p class="text-muted">I am the oldest of three brothers. My younger brother Joseph has mild-to-severe autism, which is cause for some challenges, but he is still an integral part of our family. My youngest brother Isaiah is a typical teenager,
                                        and he loves to play and hang out with me, even more so now that I am at college. All three of us enjoy video games, particularly Nintendo games. In fact, we each have different favorite video game franchises: Joseph
                                        (whom we call Joe) enjoys Kirby games, Isaiah enjoys Pikmin games, and all three of us (but especially me) love the Super Mario franchise. Mom is a very good cook; her home-cooked meals are to die for, a fact made
                                        more clear during my time at BJU (not that I'm ungrateful for the food here). My dad is a US Marine (active duty). He has been stationed at several locations across the world throughout his career. He is currently
                                        a Colonel and is working at the Pentagon in the Washington metro area.</p>

                                    <h3>Faith</h3>
                                    <p class="text-muted">The Lord has blessed me with a godly heritage that runs through my extended family. All of my family members are saved, and I am grateful that I am one of God's children. I am secure in Him, and the devil cannot take
                                        me back. I am thankful for the godly influences that have been put in my life, from my parents at home, to my friends at BJU. I still have much to grow in, and God will give the grace needed to grow. God is going
                                        to take me through life in His loving care, and therefore I can trust Him and not fear. God is so good to send His Son Jesus Christ to die on the cross and rise again on the third day to provide eternal salvation
                                        from our sins. My hope is that more will come to know the Savior personally, that they would be rescued from their sin, and that I would be a testimony to those around me of the saving power of the gospel in my
                                        life.&nbsp;</p>
